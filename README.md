This is a still very bare-bones start of a project to create a web-application version of Oggdude's SWRPG Character Generator. It's obviously not a carbon-copy, and Oggdude's is closed-source, so everything's built from the ground up. Still, I have lofty goals and everything's progressing mostly smoothly!

Getting Started

    Copy .env.examples to .env files.

    Edit VITE_API_BASE_URL to point at your running API (e.g. http://localhost:7240)

    npm install && npm run dev
